Calling components 
<ExampleComponent/>
React supports the Camel Case
classname instead of class
Props refers to properties.Special keyword in React.Divides UI into small interface.
React is a component based library.
Functinoal component
Important part is that data with the props are being passed in aunidirectional flow(one way  form parent to child)
Props data is read only.
Cannot modify the props

Using proprs in react exapmple

class ParentComponent extends components{
    render(){
        return{
            <h1>I am parent component</h1>

        }
    }
}
class components{
    <p>I am the first child</p>

}
Output=>I am the first child 

const childComponent=(props)=>{
    return<p>{props.text}</p>

}
Prop is used to communicate between the component
why create components?
Node modules are basically javascript packages
